                                            When you sign up newly to sparrow network, your home page is normally empty at the middle. This is because:<br> 
                                            1. You have no chirps yet.<br>
                                            2. You are not following anybody yet.<br>
                                            Chirps are contents you place on sparrow, from your home page. To follow someone, all you have to do is search for
                                            the person using the search bar above, clicking on the link leads you to the person's profile where you can follow
                                            such person by clicking on the follow button. You can also send users personal messages (P.M), to begin a chat
                                            session. There are 4 categories of tags you could associate your chirps with, to enable users navigate to the 
                                            link associated with such tags. These tags include:<br>
